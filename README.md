# AhmedDB-SQL
Fully functional relational database management system which is designed and implemented in Java.

## Introduction
The project for learning purpose to get conceptual knowledge and experience about how a database management system works under the hood and how every component interacts with each other.
Its implementation is similar to SimpleDb which created by Edward Sciore in its [book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-33836-7) but with modified APIs to be more understandable with extended features and appropriate documentation comments.

## Features

- Functionally, it is a multiuser, transaction-oriented database server that executes SQL statements and interacts with clients via JDBC.
- Structurally, it contains the same basic components as a commercial database management system, with similar APIs.
